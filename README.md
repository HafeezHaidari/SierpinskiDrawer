# SierpinskiDrawer
JavaFX program that draws a Sierpinski Triangle point by point
Build in June 2022

- I have not been able to create a .jar file due to problems with IntelliJ, if you are able to create a .jar file let me know.
- In order to get it to run you must have JavaFX-SDK installed on your system.

# How it works
On startup the main window will be blank. You will have to click ("draw") 3 random points onto the canvas, creating a triangle and then a fourth one, whereever you choose. 
Click on "Create Sierpinski Triangle" and the app will draw one extra tiny rectangle per buttonclick. You can change the number of points drawn by entering a 
number at the input section next to the "Create Sierpinski Triangle" button. You could write "5000" as the magnitude but the amount drawn in capped at 2876. 
You can change the color of the drawing and then clear the canvas after.

# Important:

- As project was made in IntelliJ, there may be complications using other IDEs.
- Files have references to files in "resources" folder. To avoid problems, download entire repository as zip file then unzip, open whole folder in IDE and run the main.java class
